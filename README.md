<h2>What is Clothest?</h2><br>
Clothest is an web application that I made that helps Hypebeast keeps track of what items they have in their closet. With Clothest, you can create a virtual cloest that you can bring it on the go and wow others with your collection.

<h2>Planning</h2><br>
I wrote out my HTML first, created the basic layout of the webpage and did some research on how to display each of the products. After I have basic layout finished, I worked on the back end API. After I finished the API, tested, I would add in the CSS and perfect V1. V2 would be adding in the second table, the selling website table. V3 would be a joins table between the product table and the selling website table

<h2>User Stories</h2><br>
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account to track all my products.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to change my password to my account in case someone else have figured out my password.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to add new products and have the ability to update and delete said items when ever I want.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to have the page automatically refresh whenever any changes is made.<br>

<h2>Problem solving</h2><br>
- Utilizing console.log with every action to determin what each function is putting.<br>
- Utilizing documentation on methods to find different ways of using it in my application.<br>
- Breaking down large issues into more managable issues and solving each one before moving on.<br>
- Constantly commiting changes, so when I mess up, I had a clear commit history to refer back to when lost.<br>
- Instead of creating new tables that will get added, I decided to use model as it was more elegant. However, models proved to be a bit more challenging as sometimes it was hard to have it display exactly what I wanted to dispaly.<br>
<hr>
<h2>Adding Features</h2><br>
- Given more time, I would like to add another table that has all the popular resale websites out there.<br>
- Create a third table that would be a joins table of the product table and the website table so I can have listing information.<br>

<h2>Development Process</h2><br>
I followed my plan pretty much exactly like I planned, except everything took longer than I expected. I kept on running into some small problems that took for ages to figure out, but it turns out that most of the problems were small typos and extra commas, etc.
